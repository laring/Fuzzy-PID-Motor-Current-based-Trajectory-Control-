However, the algorithms of intelligent control are often computationally intensive and structurally complex, making them impractical for real-world applications. In light of the nonlinear characteristics of certain systems, where accurate mathematical models are unattainable, the features of nonlinear PID control are advantageous for systems with low model accuracy. This scheme exhibits robust anti-interference capabilities and effectively enhances system control precision. Nevertheless, it has been noted to have a slower tracking speed for input signals.
To evaluate the efficacy of fuzzy control, a tool capable of real-time positioning of the mobile robot was employed. The optimization design of the fuzzy PID controller was based on variations in motor current. Under different conditions, tests and observations were conducted, and the proposed fuzzy control method provided a favorable tracking response. The actual test outcomes were also effective, offering a novel perspective for the control of path stability.
